# Diversity_Hack
 Vodafone and Code First Girls hackathon to promote diversity and inclusion in the hiring process. Our team consisted of four members and we created a website in two weeks called EDIH (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in Hiring). This is a platform for applicants to apply for jobs and hide their personal information, so they are only assessed on their skills, attributes and passion for the role. An email is then sent to the employer consisting of this redacted application form, where the employer can choose to progress the applicant onto the next stage or not. If the decision is to progress the applicant, the full application form will then be released to the employer so they can contact the applicant. The original application form is also emailed to the applicant upon original submission. 
 
 EDIH also provides information about the top 10 UK employers for diversity, popular job application websites, and a User Stories section where people can post about their application experiences. Also, we provide a blog with statistics and articles about diversity in the hiring process and workplace, with examples of bias-free language that is recommended to use on job applications.
