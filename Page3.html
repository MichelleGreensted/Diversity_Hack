                      <p><br>Often, without even realizing it, people use offensive or problematic language in the workplace.<span id="dots">...

                      </span><span id="more"> In some cases, the offenses are blatant and obvious, but frequently they are subtle or hidden in the historic origins of the phrase. Regardless of intent, using these words can risk your reputation and be off-putting to many. Even worse, their use can be devastating to potential applicants, demoralizing for current employees, and damaging to the inclusive company culture you want to build.
                      <br><br>
                      One useful tool to check out would be Textio, which has the capability to call an author’s attention to offensive phrases in their writing. we are focusing on language that might be well-intentioned but is nevertheless offensive. Specifically, they are targeting language that disrespects a person’s identity or is rooted in racist, sexist, or ableist origins.
                        
                      To help writers be more informed and intentional in their communication, they gathered expertise from a number of sources, including dictionaries that document derogatory and offensive language; the American Psychology Association’s Style Guide for Bias-Free Language; and organizations working at the intersection of social justice and language, such as Advancement Project, The Opportunity Agenda, and Race Forward.</span></p>

                  <h4>9 Women Share Their Advice on Breaking into Engineering</h4>
                  <h7><i>by Sylvia Ann Hewlett. Sep 27, 2020</i></h7>
                  <div class="fakeimg">
                      
                      <p><br>The issue with women in engineering (or lack of) seems to be a bit of a ‘chicken and egg’ situation. Women need someone who they can look up to in the industry, but in many places that doesn’t exist.<span id="dots">...

                      </span><span id="more2">I think if we educated children more on STEM in primary and secondary school, you’d see an increase of females going into the industry. As mentioned, I didn’t even know what mechanical engineering was until I’d finished my GCSEs! At school, woodwork and bricklaying was offered, but from my experience it was always boys on those courses, which I understand can put girls off.
                      <br><br>
                      There’s so much you are able to do with engineering; it’s a field that’s interesting and ever-changing. If you’re into science, technology, maths, enjoy being challenged and want to make a real world impact, then engineering could be for you!
                        
                      The industry itself is starting to make progress, but it’s slow. I recently spoke at a women in engineering event, for children aged 12+, and was asked a lot of questions about gender diversity in the industry and how I felt about it. It was so nice being able to respond, honestly, that I’ve never once felt out of place or treated differently by my male colleagues.</span></p>

                  <h4>How Diversity Can Drive Innovation</h4>
                  <h7><i>by Laura Sherbin. Sep 21, 2020</i></h7>
                  <div class="fakeimg">
                      
                      <p><br>Most managers accept that employers benefit from a diverse workforce, but the notion can be hard to prove or quantify, especially when it comes to measuring how diversity affects a firm’s ability to innovate.<span id="dots">...

                      </span><span id="more3">But new research provides compelling evidence that diversity unlocks innovation and drives market growth—a finding that should intensify efforts to ensure that executive ranks both embody and embrace the power of differences. In this research, which rests on a nationally representative survey of 1,800 professionals, 40 case studies, and numerous focus groups and interviews, we scrutinized two kinds of diversity: inherent and acquired. 
                        <br><br>
                        Inherent diversity involves traits you are born with, such as gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Acquired diversity involves traits you gain from experience: Working in another country can help you appreciate cultural differences, for example, while selling to female consumers can give you gender smarts. We refer to companies whose leaders exhibit at least three inherent and three acquired diversity traits as having two-dimensional diversity.
                       <br><br>
                        By correlating diversity in leadership with market outcomes as reported by respondents, we learned that companies with 2-D diversity out-innovate and out-perform others. Employees at these companies are 45% likelier to report that their firm’s market share grew over the previous year and 70% likelier to report that the firm captured a new market.</span></p>
