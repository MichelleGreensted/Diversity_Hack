                            <p class="card-text">Too many times, I have come across bias in the application process of various roles. Job adverts that have the criteria of candidates coming from a ‘Russel Group’ or ‘good’ university assumes that students from these educational backgrounds are better suited to the role than students who did not.<br><br>I do not agree with this assumption. Students choose their university due to the course and modules offered, location and their financial situation. Applicants should be assessed on their skills, attributes and passion for the role – nothing else. I look forward to a world where this is the case, and EDIH is a fantastic platform for making hiring a completely un-bias process.

Now, with EDIH, I can trust that application selections are purely based off my skillset and qualifications. <br><br>Also, It’s great knowing that employers who are listing jobs on this site are aligning diversity practices with their organisational goals, and also implementing productive diversity strategies to help their employees feel included!

                            <p class="card-text">Throughout my career journey I have faced numerous situations during which I have experienced hiring bias. One such time was when I applied for the position of Software Developer for which my guy friend and I applied. I felt prepared for the application process and knew that I have all the needed skills for the job. My friend, on the other hand, applied more out of interest to see if he has any luck - he did not have the needed qualifications. I was rejected right away, without even been given the opportunity to attend an interview. My Resume and Cover Letter were very specific for this position and highlighted exactly that I had exactly what the company was looking for. In the end, my friend was called for an interview, even though he had only one work experience in the sphere of Computer Science and they even offered him the position. However, even he was quite amazed by the fact they made him an offer and rejected them based on his feeling that he is not suited for the job. 
This moment in my life made me experience first handedly the hiring bias in the technology field. I know that I have the needed skills and that I am the best version of myself and I strongly believe that this knowledge should not be measured by your personal information like your name or gender. I support EDIH in their pursuit to work on that issue and make a positive change.

                            <p class="card-text">As a young woman and a member of an ethnic minority, conscious and unconscious hiring bias is something I’ve been very aware of throughout my job searching process. With EDIH shifting the focus to my skills and passion for the industry, I’m able to present myself as a valuable candidate without worrying about my identity having a negative impact. Knowing I’ve been selected based purely on the strength of my application is also incredibly rewarding, and gives me confidence in the increasing diversity this will allow for in our workforce.
